An assignment given to me by a potential employer to complete. 

Ive been lucky enough to have worked most of my career for companies who had me under an NDA. This repo is here as a sample of code I actually do own, as I cannot post most of the code I've spent considerable time on. I will be posting more of these as they come up. 



ASSIGNMENT:
Write a web application that randomly generates 3 set of 6 numbers where each number is a value from 1 to 49.   A button is clicked to request the 3 sets for display.  The user is allowed to select 1 set or regenerate 3 new sets.  Once the user selects a set of numbers, that set is stored in a table.
 
On each iteration of generating 3 sets, the application verifies that no set has more than 3 matching values of a previously selected set (not generated, only compared to sets selected and saved in the table).  If a generated set has matching values to a previous set, it is displayed on the screen for the user to see during the selection process.
 
Lastly, the bottom of the web application screen shows a dashboard summarizing information about generated and selected sets.
